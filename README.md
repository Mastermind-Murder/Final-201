# Final-201

## Mastermind Murder (Clue)

## Summary of idea

- We will be developing a clue based murder mystery game that has rooms with different hints and will allow the user to choose the room and then allow for them to learn who, what weapon, and how the individual was murdered. With each room will come a background story and a weapons that will be specific to the room.

## What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

- The animation of the clue cards and how to utilize them and at what stage they would be available to view. The implementation of running either a single js file or multiple for each room to function off of. Keeping each room specific to the story and allow for maximum progress of the idea.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition

- What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day? Have a minimum of 2 rooms to allow for multiple users to be able to have an interactive experience and get a new story from them. With four clue cards and a backstory to each room.
