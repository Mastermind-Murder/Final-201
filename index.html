        State who made their fortune in Canned Spam. During the cocktail party, Robert was found dead in his home office. 
        There are a total of 10 guests at the party, but only 4 are suspects. There are 2 rooms to go through and each room will 
        have clues to challenge your a different scenario, murder weapon, and murderer to challenge your deductive reasoning.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each room you enter will have 4 cards with clues such as a particular suspect's alibi, a discovered murder
        weapon, a strong motive, etc. When you feel confident enough, you will return to the scene of the crime where
        you can try to name the Mastermind of Murder!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Game rules:</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="Game Rules">To succeed in the game, you will need to correctly name the Mastermind of Murder with as few clues collected as
        possible. You will start with 12 total points. Each clue card will consume one of your points, but correctly
        naming the Mastermind of Murder will award you two bonus points.

        Alexander was ruthless and cultivated many enemies among his friends.</p>
